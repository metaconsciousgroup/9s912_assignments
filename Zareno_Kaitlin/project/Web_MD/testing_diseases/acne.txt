What Are the Symptoms of Acne?
 

The symptoms of acne are:

Persistent, recurrent red spots or swelling on the skin, generally known as pimples; the swelling may become inflamed and fill with pus. They typically appear on the face, chest, shoulders and/or neck, or upper portion of the back.
Dark spots with open pores at the center (blackheads)
Tiny white bumps under the skin that have no obvious opening (whiteheads)
Red swellings or lumps (known as papules) that are visibly filled with pus
Nodules or lumps under the skin that are inflamed, fluid-filled, and often tender; these nodules may become as large as an inch across.
